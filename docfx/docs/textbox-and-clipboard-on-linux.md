Myra uses [TextCopy](https://github.com/SimonCropp/TextCopy) for the text clipboard operations.

This library requires `clip` to be installed in order to work on Linux.

If it's not installed, then Myra will fallback to its own clipboard, which will work only within the application using Myra(i.e. it wont be possible to select/copy text in some other app and paste into app with Myra).
