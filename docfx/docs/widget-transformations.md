Every widget has following transformation properties:

Name|Type|Default|Description
----|----|-------|-----------
Scale|Vector2|1, 1|Scaling
Rotate|float|0|Rotation angle in degrees
TransformOrigin|Vector2|0.5, 0.5|Normalized origin of every transform. Default value(0.5, 0.5) means that it is set to the center of the widget

Desktop has same set of properties. Though default value for the TransformOrigin is (0, 0), which is top-left corner.
